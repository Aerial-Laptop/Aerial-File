# ⛔️ WIP

### Aerial File
 A file sharing service, intended to be the successor to A-Share! Users may use an API via POST and GET requests to exchange files. 
I plan to write some sort of interface for cross-platform use of the API via a GUI, perhaps [PWAs](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/).

### TODO
Applications with configurations for servers and a way to view history
Better documentaion
